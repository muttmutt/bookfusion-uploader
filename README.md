# ðŸ“š BookFusion CLI Uploader (`bf_uploader.py`)

Upload your ebooks to [BookFusion](https://www.bookfusion.com) using their Calibre-style API â€” **no Calibre required**.

This Python script replicates the behavior of the Calibre plugin, including:
- S3-backed file upload
- Digest computation for metadata and file
- Finalization with Rails-style form submission

Works great for scripting, automation, and metadata-rich library management.
